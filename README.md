# Relativity
A small visualization of the effects of relativity on objects.

## Install
This project uses only SFML as library, you can thus install it (tutorial [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/)) or directly use the precompiled version in the release tab of this project (all-in-one exe file [here](https://github.com/couisse/Relativity/releases))

## Usage 
The program will let you create multiple galilean frames of reference you'll be able to cycle through, to see the effects of Lorentz's transformation, including:
* Time dilation
* Length contraction
* Loss of synchronization
* constancy of EM waves travel speed
<!-- End of list -->
To do so, each frame of reference will include an infinite line of regularly spaced squared with synchronized (in their reference frame) pulsating light at 1Hz, and a travelling EM on top of screen.\
NOTE: be careful to reead all the text in the console, even though another window popped up.\
NOTE: the program still has a lot of bugs. In case a problem arises, don't hesitate to kill the window/process, it won't cause any harm to your device.

## Future
Other functionalities may one day be added, like a more general relativistic mechanics engines
